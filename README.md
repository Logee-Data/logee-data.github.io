# How to add or modify a post?

Go to `_posts` and create a new markdown (`.md`) file for new post, or find the respective file of the post you want to modify. If you are about to create a new post, make sure that you include the post metadata like the following:

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: "Data Team Update 2023 - Week 1"
date: 2023-01-05 16:47:06 +0700
categories: data update
---
```

as the header of your markdown file. The `body` of the post is after the post metadata. Add or modify the content of the post using markdown syntax.

After you have done, make sure your current branch is `main`, and then commit the file and push it into GitHub as usual. Wait for a minute or two, and you can check the post at `https://logee-data.github.io`.
